# AWS Organizations

## [AWS](README.md) / AWS Organizations

[AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html) provide a native way to manage multiple AWS accounts. They provide consolidated billing, APIs \(e.g., via Terraform\) for automating account creation, and the ability to apply account-wide IAM like policies.

As security best practices prefer account boundaries over IAM policies as a way to limit resource access, AWS Organizations are becoming a standard part of any AWS deployment.

### Truss Patterns

As Truss has begun adopting AWS Organizations for most of our new projects, we have developed a number of patterns for organizations. For a more thorough description of the process of bootstrapping a new AWS Organization, see the [Bootstrapping an AWS Organization](org-bootstrap.md) document, but below is a brief description of the patterns we've adopted.

#### The Organization Root Account

* Pick a standard prefix you can use for all the accounts in your

  organization; for our example we'll use `spacecats`.

* The first account you should create is the "org-root" account for the

  organization, which is where you will configure organization-wide

  resources. We call this the "org-root" account and name it like

  `spacecats-org-root`. \*This account should not be used for anything

  else -- no application should use resources from this account.\*

* There should be as few users with IAM access to the `org-root`

  account as possible; generally only infrastructure engineers and

  an "owner" from the client. Their IAM users in this account should

  be suffixed with `.org-root` in order to distinguish them from

  IAM users in other accounts \(such as `alice.org-root`\).

* You can use the

  [`terraform-aws-org-scp`](https://github.com/trussworks/terraform-aws-org-scp)

  module to get a base set of \[Service Control

  Policies\]\([https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs\_manage\_policies\_scp.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scp.html)\)

  to apply to OUs created in this account.

* Create a `suspended` OU for the organization in this account which

  you can place accounts into if you think they have been compromised

  or are exhibiting strange behavior. It can also be used for dummy

  accounts for [GovCloud](govcloud/README.md) deployments.

* To bootstrap other accounts, you can define them here with the

  [`aws_organizations_account`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/organizations_account.html)

  Terraform resource. Once they are created, you can access them using

  IAM users in this account by assuming the

  [`OrganizationAccountAccessRole`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_access.html)

  in the subsidiary accounts.

* You can create a `billing` role in this account that can be assumed by

  product or delivery managers \(with their accounts in the ID account\)

  to give them access to billing information _without_ giving them access

  to this account directly.

* The `root` password for this account should be reset each time an admin

  leaves the project or at least once every six months, just to ensure

  that it is not leaked.

#### The ID Account

* The second account you create should be the ID account. This account

  will be used to define the IAM users and groups that people will use

  on a day-to-day basis. We name this like `spacecats-id`.

* When creating this account, be sure to set the `iam_user_access_to_billing`

  parameter for the account to `ALLOW` \(all other accounts should have

  this set to `DENY`\). Doing by doing this, we can allow users to see the

  billing data without having to give them direct access to the `org-root`

  account. \*This cannot be changed once the account is created, so be sure

  to do it now.\*

* To access other accounts, we assign group policies which allow direct role assumption.

  We use [`iam-user-group`](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/trussworks/iam-user-group/aws/1.0.2) and [`iam-cross-acct-dest`](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/trussworks/iam-cross-acct-dest/aws) modules to do this; see [`terraform-layout-example`](https://github.com/trussworks/terraform-layout-example) for how we use them.

* Like the `org-root` account, other than the IAM users and groups, we

  should avoid putting any other resources in this account.

#### The Infra Account

* You will probably also need an infra account for your organization.

  This account will contain resources that are organization-wide but are

  only used to handle infrastructure concerns. We name this account like

  `spacecats-infra`.

* Examples of resources appropriate for this account might be an Atlantis

  deployment for the organization or DNS for your root domain.

* If you define the root domain here \(say, `spacecats.com`\), we can then

  delegate subdomains \(like `dev.spacecats.com`\) to other accounts, which

  allows application engineers to define new DNS entries in dev or sandbox

  accounts without giving them access to other DNS resources.

#### Other Accounts

* Other than the above accounts, the organization structure is relatively

  freeform, or at least flexible.

* Remember that accounts are essentially "free" in terms of monetary cost,

  at least. This means we can use them to segregate resources based on

  access. On some projects, placing each environment into a different

  account makes perfect sense; on others, we might only want production

  to be in a separate account.

### Best Practices

These are the best practices gleaned from online resources and our experiences on various projects.

* For the email address for each of your accounts, create an infrastructure

  alias \(like `spacecats-infra@truss.works`\) and then for each AWS account,

  set the email address to be that alias, with a `+` suffix for each

  account, so you can identify where these emails came from. For instance,

  we might make the email address for `spacecats-org-root` to be

  `spacecats-infra+aws-org-root@truss.works`, the one for the ID account

  to be `spacecats-infra+aws-org-id@truss.works`, etc. This email will be

  where support responses and other notifications about your AWS accounts

  will be sent.

* As stated above, _severely limit access to the org-root account._ This

  account provides access to everything else in the organization, and

  as a result poses a significant security risk if compromised. Use IAM

  roles and the ID account to provide granular access to resources.

* Pick whether your SCPs will be whitelists or blacklists; avoid mixing:

  understanding what happens when a whitelist SCP inherits a blacklist

  SCP \(or vice versa\) is too complicated.

  * Prefer blacklists as these allow folks to experiment with new

    services â€” staying out of the way of engineers.

  * Use whitelists for larger organizations operating in high compliance

    environments. For example, this could let a large health care company

    only allow access to HIPAA approved services. Whitelists require more

    maintenance as new services need to get manually added to the whitelist

    as they are approved.

* Create a top-level OU that everything else is under. This makes it easy

  to apply policies across all accounts \(e.g., enforce encrypted data\).
