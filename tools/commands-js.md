# Command's JS

A lot of tools today are offering a whole set of functionality to interact with their products. I believe utilising CLI’s is massively important for enhancing productivity when developing. I've listed ones that are documented well so you will have to check it out to figure out how to use them optimally.

We didn’t get to go over these in the first edition, but let’s get into it.

[Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download) is Vercel’s CLI tool for dead simple deployment.  
`npm install -g vercel`

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/docs/cli/) is a no frills builder, deployment tool and manager of modern web projects.  
`npm install -g netlify-cli`

[Surge](https://github.com/sintaxi/surge) is a tool to publish web apps to a CDN.  
`npm install -g surge`

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-cli/) is a Static Site Generator and Progressive Application Generator.  
`npm install -g gatsby-cli`

[~~create-react-app~~](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) ~~creates a React app.
