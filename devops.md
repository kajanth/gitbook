# Devops

**DevOps Basics**

**What Is DevOps?** DevOps is the practice of operations and development engineers participating together through the entire service lifecycle; from the design and development process all the way to production support. DevOps is also characterized by operations staff making use of many of the same techniques as developers for their systems work.

Blameless Postmortems contain:

1. A description of the incident
2. A description of the root cause
3. How the incident was stabilized or fixed.
4. A timeline of events including all actions taken to resolve the incident
5. How the incident affected customers
6. Remediations and corrective actions.

Transparent Uptime means: 1. Admit Failure 2. Sound Like A Human 3. Have A Communication Channel 4. Above All Else, Be Authentic

**Infrastructure as Code, by Martin Fowler** [http://martinfowler.com/bliki/InfrastructureAsCode.html](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/InfrastructureAsCode.html)

Provisioning is the process of making a server ready for operation, including hardware, OS, system services, network connectivity. Deployment is the process of automatically deploying and upgrading applications on a server. Orchestration is the act of performing coordinated operations across multiple systems. Configuration management is an overarching term dealing with change control of system configuration after initial provision, but is often also applied to maintaining and upgrading application and application dependencies. Imperative - also known as “procedural,” this is an approach where commands desired to produce a state are defined and executed. Declarative - also known as “functional,” this is an approach where you define a desired state and the tool converges the existing system on the model. Idempotent - the ability to execute the CM procedure repeatedly and end up in the same state each time. Self service - is the ability for an end user to kick off one of these processes without having to go through other people.

### Your Infrastructure Toolchain

Infastructure as Code \(IaC\) and Configuration Management \(CM\) Tools: CloudFormation and Terraform are provisioning tools: They are designed to provision the server instances themselves, leaving the job of configuring those servers to other tools.

Ansible, Puppet, SaltStack, and Chef are considered to be configuration management \(CM\) tools and were created to install and manage software on existing server instances \(e.g., installation of packages, starting of services, installing scripts or config files on the instance\). They do the heavy lifting of making one or many instances perform their roles without the user needing to specify the exact commands. No more manual configuration or ad-hoc scripts are needed.

Chef and Ansible use a procedural style language where you write code that specifies, step-by-step, how to achieve the desired end state. CloudFormation, Terraform, SaltStack, and Puppet use a declarative style where you write code that specifies the desired end state.

### SRE

The SRE concept \(Site Reliability Engineering\) was created by Google. It's increasingly common in organizations seeking to advance adoption of DevOps and run highly reliable services. Key characteristics of SRE are:

* Highly skilled engineering function with deep operations and delivery skill set 
* Specialist knowledge area drives application and platform stability, reliability, scalability, performance, fault tolerance, disaster readiness, logging, monitoring and capacity planning practices
* Defines, builds and evolves best practices, standards and tool sets to improve availability, performance and operational efficiency
* Scalable and cost effective approach \(focused on automation, enabling teams and creating tools\) 
* Proven function at companies such as Google, Twitter, Uber, LinkedIn, Facebook and others

SREs are typically a 50/50 blend of engineering and operations skill sets so can directly contribute to application code as well as understanding what it takes to design and run a high quality service at global scale.

**ELK Stack** [https://www.elastic.co/webinars/introduction-elk-stack](https://www.elastic.co/webinars/introduction-elk-stack) „ELK“ represents:

* Elasticsearch: Log aggregator
* Logstash: Agent to send logs into Elasticsearch
* Kibana: GUI web interface to search logs

  Note that ELK requires memory, the standard config recommends 2GB.

  To learn how to set up alerts and notifications with ELK stack, please refer to the following: [https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch-alerting](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch-alerting)

### Lean

7 Principles of Lean Software Development

* ELIMINATE WASTE
* AMPLIFY LEARNING
* DECIDE AS LATE AS POSSIBLE
* DELIVER AS FAST AS POSSIBLE
* EMPOWER THE TEAM
* BUILD INTEGRITY IN
* SEE THE WHOLE

The Seven Wastes \(Muda\) of Lean Software Waste \#1 - Partially Done Work Waste \#2 - Extra Features Waste \#3 - Relearning Waste \#4 - Handoffs Waste \#5 - Delays Waste \#6 - Task Switching Waste \#7 - Defects

Build-Measure-Learn

* BUILD – MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT
* MEASURE – THE OUTCOME AND INTERNAL METRICS
* LEARN – ABOUT YOUR PROBLEM AND YOUR SOLUTION
* REPEAT – GO DEEPER WHERE IT’S NEEDED
